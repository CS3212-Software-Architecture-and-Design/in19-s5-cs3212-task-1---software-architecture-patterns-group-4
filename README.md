# CS3212-Software Architecture and Design
## Peer-to-Peer Architecture Pattern - Demo Application

`A peer-to-peer architecture, or P2P, is a network where members connect directly with each other without any intermediary.`

`One member can take on the role of both client and server, according to their needs.`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In real world, P2P arcitecture is used in following applications;

  1.  File sharing (Ex: BitTorrent)
  
  2.  Instant messaging 
  
  3.  Voice Communication (Ex: Skype)
  
  4.  Collaboration (Ex: BearShare)
  
  5.  High Performance Computing
  
  6.  Streaming media (Ex: Napster)
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains a simple Terminal Based Peer to Peer Instant Messaging Application.

to get started, you only needs to run `client.py`

For demonstration purpose, the 'localhost' (127.0.0.1) is used as the host address and random port numbers are generated.

The Application lets you to 

  1.  message other clients with known addresses
  
  2.  message with previously contacted clients by choosing from a list
  
  3.  receive messages
  
  4.  reply to the received messages
  
All the functionalities are facilitated on `terminal interface` and `UDP` is used as the communication protocol since it needs not to keep a static connection.

Your kind opinions/ suggestions are always welcomed in improving this simple project.
